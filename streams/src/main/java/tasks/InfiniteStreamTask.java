        TASK
        • The Fibonacci series is famous as a classic programming exercise. The
        numbers in the following sequence are part of the Fibonacci series. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
        8, 13, 21, 34, 55…. The first two numbers of the series are 0 and 1, and each
        subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
        • The series of Fibonacci tuples is similar; you have sequence of a number and
        its successor in the series : (0,1),(1,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,5)…
        • You task is to generate the first 20 elements of the series of Fibonacci tuples
        using iterate method.
            Stream.iterate(new int[]{0,1},???)
            .limit(20)
            .forEach(t -> System.out.println("("+t[0]+","+t[1]+")"));

        /*
        TASK
        Print the Fibonacci series in normal way. (Following of previous task)
